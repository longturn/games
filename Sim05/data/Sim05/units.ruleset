Without knowledge of Electricity, this requires a nearby source of water: an ocean, lake, or river tile, or another tile with an irrigation system, must share an edge (not just a corner) with the target tile. Once Electricity is known, irrigation systems may be built without a water source. Once irrigated, land remains so even if the water source is removed. When Refrigeration is known, irrigation systems can be upgraded to Farmland by irrigating them a second time; this provides more food to a city if it has a Supermarket.","Building a mine on suitable terrain increases the \number of production points produced by that tile. However, it is not possible to have an irrigation system and a mine on the same tile.","On terrain unsuitable for irrigation systems or mines, issuing the \\\"irrigate\" or \"mine\" order may permanently convert the terrain to another type; this is usually more expensive. For instance, Forest may be \"irrigated\" to yield Plains. (Terrain conversion with the \"irrigate\" order does not require a water source.)","Workers can build airbases and buoys, which Settlers and Migrants cannot.
